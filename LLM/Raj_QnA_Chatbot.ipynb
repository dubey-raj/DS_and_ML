The Indian  economy  has witnessed profound positive \\ntransformation in the last ten years. The people of India are \\nlooking ahead to the future with hope and optimism.  \\n2. With the blessings of the people, when our Government \\nunder the visionary and dynamic leadership of Hon’ble Prime \\nMinister Shri Narendra Modi assumed office in 2014, the country \\nwas facing enormous challenges. With ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka \\nVikas’  as its ‘mantra’ , the Government overcame those \\nchallenges in right earnest. Structural reforms were undertaken. \\nPro-people programmes were formulated and implemented \\npromptly. Conditions were cr eated for more opportunities for \\nemployment and entrepreneurship. The economy got a new \\nvigour. The fruits of development started reaching the people at \\nscale. The country got a new sense of purpose and hope. \\nNaturally, the people blessed the Government wi th a bigger \\nmandate.  '),\n",

In the second term, our Government under the leadership \\nof Hon’ble Prime Minister doubled down on its responsibilities to \\nbuild a prosperous country with comprehensive development of \\nall people and all regions. Our Government strengthened its \\n‘mantra’  to ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, and Sabka Vishwas’. Our \\ndevelopment philosophy covered all elements of inclusivity, \\nnamely,  \\n\\uf0b7 social inclusivity through coverage of all strata of the \\nsociety, and  \\n\\uf0b7 geographical  inclusivity through development of all \\nregions of the country.   \\n4. With the ‘whole of nation’ approach of ‘Sabka Prayas’, t he \\ncountry overcame the challenge of a once -in-a-century \\npandemic, took long strides towards ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’, \\ncommitted to ‘Panch  Pran’ , and laid solid foundations for the  \\n‘Amrit Kaal’. As a result, our young country has high aspiration s, \\npride in its present, and hope and confidence for a bright future. \\nWe expect that our Government , based on  its stupendous work , \\nwill be blessed ag ain by the people with a resounding mandate.  \\nInclusive Development and Growth  \\n5. Our humane and inclusive approach to development is a \\nmarked and deliberate departure from the earlier approach of \\n‘provisioning up -to-village level’. Development programmes , in \\nthe last ten years, have targeted each and every household and \\nindividual, through ‘housing for all’, ‘har ghar jal’ , electricity for '),\n",

The worries about food have been eliminated through free \\nration for 80 crore people. Minimum support prices for the \\nproduce of ‘Annadata’    are periodically increased appropriately. \\nThese and the provision of basic necessities have enhanced real \\nincome in the rural areas. Their econo mic needs could be \\naddressed, thus spurring growth and generating jobs.   \\nSocial Justice   \\n7. Our Government  is working with an approach to \\ndevelopment that is  all-round, all -pervasive and all -inclusive \\n(सर्वांगीण , सर्वस्पर्शी  और सर्वसमवर्ेर्शी ). It covers all castes and \\npeople at all levels. We are working to make India a ‘Viksit \\nBharat’ by 2047. For achieving that goal, we need to improve \\npeople’s capability and empower them.  \\n8. Previously, social justice was mostly a political slogan. For \\nour Gov ernment, social justice is an effective and necessary \\ngovernance model. The saturation approach of covering all \\neligible people is the true and comprehensive achievement of \\nsocial justice. This is secularism in action, reduces corruption, \\nand prevents nepo tism (भवई-भतीजवर्वद ). There is transparency \\nand assurance that benefits are delivered to all eligible people.  \\nThe resources are distributed fairly . All, regardless of their social \\nstanding, get access to opportunities. We are addressing \\nsystemic inequaliti es that had plagued our society. We focus on '),\n",

As our Prime Minister firmly believes , we need to focus on \\nfour major castes. They are, ‘Garib’ (Poor) , ‘Mahilayen’ \\n(Women),  ‘Yuva’  (Youth) and   ‘Annadata’ (Farmer). Their needs, \\ntheir aspirations, and their welfare are our highest priority. The \\ncountry progresses, when they progress. All four require and \\nreceive government support in their quest to better their lives. \\nTheir empo werment and well -being will drive the country \\nforward.  \\nGarib Kalyan, Desh ka Kalyan  \\n10. We believe in empowering the poor. The earlier approach \\nof tackling poverty through entitlements had resulted in very \\nmodest outcomes. When the poor become empowered partners \\nin the development process, government’s power to assist them \\nalso increases mani fold. With the pursuit of ‘Sabka ka Saath’  in \\nthese 10 years , the Government has assisted 25 crore people to \\nget freedom from multi -dimensional poverty. Our Government’s \\nefforts are now getting synergized with energy and passion of \\nsuch empowered people. T his is truly elevating them from \\npoverty.   \\n11. ‘Direct Benefit Transfer’ of ` 34 lakh crore from the \\nGovernment using PM -Jan Dhan accounts has led to savings of  \\n` 2.7 lakh crore  for the Government .

From that total, 2.3 lakh have received credit for \\nthe third time.  \\n13. PM-JANMAN Yojana reaches out to the particularly \\nvulnerable tribal groups, who have remained outside  the realm \\nof development so far.

Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \\n\\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \\n\\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \\n\\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \\n\\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \\n\\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \\n\\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \\n\\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \\n\\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \\n\\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.\\nSource: 0-pl\\nContent: And we won’t stop. \\n\\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \\n\\nLet’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \\n\\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \\n\\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \\n\\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \\n\\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \\n\\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \\n\\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \\n\\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \\n\\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.\\nSource: 24-pl\\nContent: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \\n\\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \\n\\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \\n\\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \\n\\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \\n\\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming. \\n\\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.\\nSource: 5-pl\\nContent: More support for patients and families. \\n\\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \\n\\nIt’s based on DARPA—the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \\n\\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose—to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more. \\n\\nA unity agenda for the nation. \\n\\nWe can do this. \\n\\nMy fellow Americans—tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space—the citadel of our democracy. \\n\\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \\n\\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \\n\\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \\n\\nNow is the hour. \\n\\nOur moment of responsibility. \\n\\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \\n\\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed.
